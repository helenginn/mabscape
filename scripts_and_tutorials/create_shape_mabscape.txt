Get a PDB file of the protein
Open reference and new protein in PyMol
Align the full protein to your reference, if possible.
This can be done with the following command: 

align name_that_should_be_aligned, name_to_align_to

Then
If necessary, delete the  lines of the PDB file, that contain the coordinates of the unwanted atoms
Open the modified PDB in PyMOL
Make sure the newly loaded file is the only thing selected.
In the PyMol command line type:
	hide everything
	# This hides the standard view of the molecule
	show surface
	# Shows just the surface of the molecule
	set surface_solvent, on
	#
	set_view (1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)
	# This will set the coordinates relative to the camera and the coordinates in the PDB file to be equal.
	save <filename>.obj
	# Saves the surface as obj file to the PyMol folder, if an absolute path is given, file will be saved there.
